# HomeWork-Tracker
Given a dataset of location logs of a person over several days/weeks/months/years, we may want to determine which of the logged locations correspond to home and work locations of the perosn. 

This project uses the logged locations of a person over an extended period of time to determine their home(s) and work(s) locations.

## Installation
Navigate to the directory you would like to clone the project to. Clone the project using the following git bash command:

`git clone https://github.com/tarhang/HomeWork-Tracker.git`
## Dependencies
This project is originally developed in python 3.5.x with further libraries as indicated in `requirements.txt` along with their corresponding versions.

I suggest you clone the project, create a virtual environment, and install all dependencies through `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
