# HomeWork-Tracker
Given a dataset of location logs of a person over several days/weeks/months/years, we may want to determine which of the logged locations correspond to home and work locations of the perosn. 

This project uses the logged locations of a person over an extended period of time to determine their home(s) and work(s) locations.
